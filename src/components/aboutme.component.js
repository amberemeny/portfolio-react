                My name is Amber Emeny, a.k.a. The Ivy Coder, and I'm a 25 year old Full Stack Developer currently in my final semester studying at Coder Academy.<br />
                I am easily identifiable in the Brisbane tech scene by my burning passion for development and design, my bright, bubbly personality, and occasionally also bright, coloured hair.<br />
                My passion for development came from my initially self-taught experience, natural curiousity, talent for problem solving and my innate flair for design.<br />
                I continue to improve on my skills and seek out new knowlege everyday.
